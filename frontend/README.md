# Frontend

I created the project using create-react-app.
The frontend static build files are served using Nginx.
I have used the Flux pattern with Redux+Sagas because it's a pretty common pattern. It requires some setup but it's suitable for apps that will grow and maybe need special feature like manage async tasks.
The item quantity change is detected using websockets. So when someone adds or removes item from the cart every user using the app is notified by the dialog.
