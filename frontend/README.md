# Frontend

I created the project using create-react-app.<br>
The frontend static build files are served using Nginx.<br>
I have used the Flux pattern with Redux+Sagas because it's a pretty common pattern and i supposed you wanted to see this. It requires some setup but it's suitable for apps that will grow and maybe need special feature like manage async tasks.<br>
The item quantity change is detected using websockets. So when someone adds or removes item from the cart every user using the app is notified by the dialog.<br>
