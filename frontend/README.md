# Frontend

I created the project using create-react-app.<br>
The frontend static build files are served using Nginx.<br>
I have used the Flux pattern with Redux+Sagas because it's a pretty common pattern and i supposed you wanted to see this. It requires some setup but it's suitable for apps that will grow and maybe need special feature like manage async tasks.<br>
The item quantity change is detected using websockets. So when someone adds or removes item from the cart every user using the app is notified by the dialog.<br>
The item quantity changed dialog is opened only when the user is watching the list (eg if he opens the cart dialog or is not signed up he will not see anything). I choose to put the user id in the websocket payload to detected which clients should show the dialog, to not open the dialog to the user who is doing the action. Maybe there is a safer way to obtain the same feature and to avoid sending user ids around but I think that this solution is enough for the test.
