# Frontend

I created the project using create-react-app.
The FE is launched in Docker using directly the development server, I know it is not a good practice at all but for time reasons i had to do it. In a production environment i would have done the build and then served it using Nginx or Apache.
I have used the Flux pattern with Redux+Sagas because it's a pretty common pattern.
The item quantity change is detected using websockets. So when someone adds or removes item from the cart every user using the app is notified using the dialog.
