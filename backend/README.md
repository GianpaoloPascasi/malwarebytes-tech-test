# Backend

I have choosen to create the backend using NestJS. 
The authentication method is JWT and authorization is provded using NestJS guards.
To handle the item quantity change I have used websockets and events. So when an item is increased or decreased (add or removed from a cart by any user) 
the ItemService will triggher an event catched by the ItemGateway which will notify all the connected users.
Items shown in the app are created using the LoadItems migration.
