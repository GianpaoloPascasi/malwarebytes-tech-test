# Backend

I have choosen to create the backend using NestJS.<br>
The authentication method is JWT and authorization is provded using NestJS guards. I choose to use JWT because it's the most suitable solution for Rest API authentication. NestJS guards are also nice because they allow you to provide extra authorization features just using decorators on controllers or even in single endpoints. <br>
To handle the item quantity change I have used websockets and events. So when an item is increased or decreased (add or removed from a cart by any user) the ItemService will triggher an event catched by the ItemGateway which will notify all the connected users. <br>
Items shown in the app are created using the LoadItems migration. <br>
